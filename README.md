# MedTrak-Farkle

I did not have time to implement the features I originally planned, due to the fact that
relative unfamiliarity with Javascript/HTML made me need to spend a good mount of time checking syntax,
functions etc, and figuring out what would be feasible for me to do in this amount of time.

## What I started but abandoned due to time awareness, less critical:

- displaying the score where the graphics imply it should be 
- have the Farkle message (if a dice roll results in score of 0) display on screen instead of to console,
	same for '5 turns' message

## The plan for what I would keep working on/implement if given the opportunity, most critical:

- modified, single player Farkle game of chance, where the challenge is to see if you can beat 5,000 points
	in 5 turns or less (to be adjusted as necessary)
- currently the program autocalculates your max score for each roll of the dice with the player having to
	click anything, I would finish implementing the functionality that requires the player to click before
	a particular die is including in the score for that turn
- ultimately make a more complicated multiplayer game that also accounts for the choice a player has 
	in terms of either banking their points for a particular roll and passing, or going again, which I laid the groundwork
	for and mapped out in a pseudocode diagram
